# ExpressionEngine Transcribe relationship filter

This add-on allows administrators to filter the relationship entries list in the ExpressionEngine based on the language of the current entry.

### Requirements

ExpressionEngine 5.0 or newer
Transcribe 3.3.0 or newer


### Installation

Copy ```transcribe_relationship_filter``` directory to ```system/user/addons```. Enable the add-on under Developer > Add-Ons.

### Usage

By default, all relationship fields will be filtered based on the language of the current entry. Alternatively, administrators can specify which fields they want to filter using a comma-separated list of field IDs. Specific field IDs can also be excluded using the "Exclude relationship field IDs from filter" field.
